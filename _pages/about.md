Hello! I am a second-year master's student in computer science at University of Southern California. Currently, I am working on a project about constrained decoding with [Dr. Swabha Swayamdipta](https://swabhs.com/) at the [DILL lab](https://dill-lab.github.io/).

Previously, I studied math of computation at University of California - Los Angeles, where I worked with [Dr. Rishi Sonthalia](https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/rsonthal/) on developing hyperbolic graph neural networks. I was also a research assistant under the mentorship of [Dr. Laurel Perkins](https://laurelperkins.com/) at UCLA where I investigated child language acquisition via Bayesian statistics.

My research interests lie in developing computational tools to facilitate interpretability and generalizability of language models by capturing and leveraging structures in data. Here is a link to my [CV](https://xfcui.github.io/website/assets/pdf/CV_Xinyue_Cui.pdf).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
